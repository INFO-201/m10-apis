# Exercise-5
In this exercise, you'll practice using the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) to fetch movie reviews. To learn more about the API, see the [developer console](https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json).

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository, follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.
